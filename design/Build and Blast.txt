Growing game board
	Tiles for each side -
	Match starts small
	Board expands from the middle

Discovery game board
	- terrain is randomized and hidden
	-	players scan, download and reveal new terrain to the game board
	- A single block can open up many other tiles at once when it is completed
		- a small room
		- a long hallyway
	- most blocks are random, but some contain hidden pickups or structures!

	Pickup Types
