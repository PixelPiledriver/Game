Tile VS shooter

Really clear revision of the vs shooter game.

2 small tile areas

Commander
-----------------
The Player character
Strong
Carries multiple weapons
Has special powers
Can give units commands
Can collect powerups
Can Build/Repair Units
Can Hack/Dig for items and resources

X - Fire Weapon
B - Hack Tile
Y - Command Mode
A - Interact / ?

LT - Build
	 - fly wheel with AXYB options

RT - Weapons/Abilities
	 - fly wheel with AXYB options

RB - Shield
LB - ?


Command Mode
---------------
Press Y to enter command mode.
Command expendable Units - Cubits/weapons and Machines.
You can Command any Unit on your field from anywhere.
Most Units only do one thing, and then they are spent.
The idea is to create combinations of attacks, by using multiple units and your own attacks.
COMBOS!
MIXUPS!
Try to paint the opponent into a corner and deal damage they can't avoid!

Select a Unit
----------------
Cursor grid locked to usable units.

Pad - move cursor between selectable units
A - Select Unit


Attack Units
------------------
When selected an attack cursor and range are shown on the other players side 
- in your color
Pad - move the attack cursor 
A - Basic Attack
X - Advanced Attack
Y - Tactical Attack
B - Cancel Attack

Basic Attack
---------------
The Unit attacks the given destination.

Advanced Attack
-----------------
Some Attack Units have more than one type of Attack or another Ability.

Tactical Attack
-----------------
Uses the Basic attack of the Unit but in a different way.
Tatical Attacks help the player create combos and mixups, typically by delaying the attack of the unit.
Example:
Rocket Unit
	Basic - fires a single rocket that flys up and arcs down onto the enemy field.
	Tactical - Waits 3 seconds. then ... Basic Attack
This allows the player to delay several units while making other commands or attack directly so that combinations of attacks can be delivered simultaneously

Be careful using Tactical Attacks!
Units can be destroyed while they are in the Delay state by the opposing player.

Unit Types
-----------------
	Single Use
	-------------
		Most units are used up after a single attack.
		After attacking they may self destruct or run away.

	Multi Use
	-------------
		Some units have multiple uses.
		After their uses are depleted they may self destruct or run away.

	Permanants
	-------------
		A rare few units do not go away with use.
		They can however be destroyed by the opposing player.



Other Units
----------------
Units do not always attack
Dismantiller - little guy that runs around opponents field, destroying units slowly
						 - Commander must kill them



Random Ideas
------------------


Attack
------
Rocket - rocket silo
3 shot - cubit with small pistol
10 shot - 10 bullet turret
Buck shot - shotgun box

Laser Log - shoots wide rolling damage. player must jump or move

Lock enemy tiles so they are stuck into an area you can do damage to

Command Cubits
Cubits can do things
