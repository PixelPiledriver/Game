Basic Attack
---------------
The Unit attacks the given destination.

Advanced Attack
-----------------
Some Attack Units have more than one type of Attack or another Ability.

Tactical Attack
-----------------
Uses the Basic attack of the Unit but in a different way.
Tatical Attacks help the player create combos and mixups, typically by delaying the attack of the unit.
Example:
Rocket Unit
	Basic - fires a single rocket that flys up and arcs down onto the enemy field.
	Tactical - Waits 3 seconds. then ... Basic Attack
This allows the player to delay several units while making other commands or attack directly so that combinations of attacks can be delivered simultaneously

Be careful using Tactical Attacks!
Units can be destroyed while they are in the Delay state by the opposing player.

Unit Types
-----------------
	Single Use
	-------------
		Most units are used up after a single attack.
		After attacking they may self destruct or run away.


		


	Multi Use
	-------------
		Some units have multiple uses.
		After their uses are depleted they may self destruct or run away.

	Permanants
	-------------
		A rare few units do not go away with use.
		They can however be destroyed by the opposing player.
